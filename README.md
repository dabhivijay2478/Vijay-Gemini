Title: Gemini API Project

Description:

This project provides a streamlined way to build applications that leverage Google's Gemini generative AI models through the Gemini API.

Features:

Fast Start: Get going quickly with the pre-configured Gemini API template, saving you time on manual setup.
Multimodal Inputs: Process text, images, and code seamlessly using the Gemini API's multimodal capabilities.
Diverse AI Functions: Integrate features like conversational interfaces, text summarization, translation, and image captioning into your apps.
Flexibility: Available in JavaScript (Vite) and Python (notebook or Flask) to suit your preferences. (More languages and frameworks coming soon)
Prerequisites:

A Gemini API key: Obtain your API key from Google AI Studio (https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio).
Installation:

Create a new project on GitHub or clone this repository.
Follow the official instructions for setting up the Gemini API with your chosen language and framework (JavaScript or Python) from Google AI Studio (https://cloud.google.com/ai/generative-ai).
Download the required libraries and configure your project files accordingly.
Running the Project:

Open the downloaded project files in your preferred IDE.
Locate the API_KEY variable (usually in main.js or main.py).
Replace the placeholder value with your actual Gemini API key.
Run the project using the appropriate commands for your chosen language and framework (e.g., npm run dev for JavaScript with Vite).
